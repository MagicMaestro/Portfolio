# SLC (Security Line Card) Project - Uses HTML, CSS, Javascript
Developed October 2016 - January 2017
Working Tool Link: http://securitylinecard.info (attribution can be found on line 103 of the source code)

The Security Line Card is a web comparison matrix developed as a public-facing, security vendor comparison tool for Ingram Micro clients.  The purpose of the tool is to provide customers with contact information for the supporting teams of the products.  Over 30+ vendors, 4 main product categories (all security-based), and 38 subcategories.  The tool was developed by myself near the end of 2016.

Project requirements:  
•	Tool must be developed in Javascript (access to PHP server restricted to internal access only)  
•	Tool must import all data from an external file, which can be updated regularly to reflect the regular changes that occur with vendors supported by Ingram Micro, products supported by vendor, and contact information for the product teams  
•	External data file must be in a format that can be taught to a new team member with the use of supporting documentation or comments in the file  
•	Each product cell should be formatted automatically based on the type of product entered (hardware, software, cloud)  
•	Team contact info and product info (including product website, if provided) should be displayed when hovering over each cell  
•	Client should be able to select up to 5 vendors to compare through the use of a drop-down list (list must be updated automatically based on vendors listed in external data file)  
•	Clients must also be able to remove entire vendor lines from the results if desired
